⚠️ SAFETY WARNING: RESEARCH ARTIFACT ONLY

This software is designed to induce cognitive biases and hallucinations in Language Models.

By definition, a model steered with SOMA_TK is unreliable, unsafe, and biased.

DO NOT use this tool for medical, financial, or legal advice.

DO NOT deploy steered models in user-facing production environments.

DO NOT use for decision-making systems.

The authors (NuvolaProject) assume no liability for any outputs generated by the model or decisions made based on them. This is an artistic and scientific research tool intended solely for exploring the interpretability and safety margins of LLMs.

By downloading and using this software, you agree that you are solely responsible for any consequences arising from its use.
